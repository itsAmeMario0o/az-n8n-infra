# NETWORKING MODULE - DATA SOURCES
# =============================================================================
# This file contains data sources specific to networking resources that may
# need to reference existing Azure networking infrastructure or validate
# network configurations.

# Currently no external data sources are required for the networking module.
# This file is included for future extensibility and to maintain consistent
# module structure across all modules.

# Future data sources might include:
# - Existing VNets for peering
# - DNS zones for custom domain configuration
# - Route tables for custom routing
# - Network watchers for monitoring
