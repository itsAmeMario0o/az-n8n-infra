# SECURITY MODULE - DATA SOURCES
# =============================================================================
# This file contains data sources specific to security resources that may
# need to reference existing Azure security infrastructure or validate
# security configurations.

# Currently no external data sources are required for the security module.
# This file is included for future extensibility and to maintain consistent
# module structure across all modules.

# Future data sources might include:
# - Existing NSGs for rule reference
# - Azure Security Center policies
# - Key Vault references for certificates
# - Azure Firewall configurations for integration
